Feature: Choosing a candidate
 As a user
 I want to evaluate the proposals regardless of the candidate
 In order to keep away from political party.


    Background: 
        Given I am on my perfil’s page
  	    When I click on the “Quem devo votar?” link
        Then I should see "Formulario de propostas"
    @javascript
    Scenario: view candidate’s proposal.
	   When I see “Formulario de propostas”
	   Then I should see a text "Educação"
	   And I should see a text "Saude"
	And I should see a text "Segurança"
	And I fill the form with my preferences
	Then I should see the candidate most fill my preferences
